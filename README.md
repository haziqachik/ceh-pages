# CEH Practice Pages

This repository hosts my saved **CEH practice pages** for personal study.  
I organized the raw HTML into a working GitHub Pages site with:

- Clean repo structure (`pages/`, `resources/`, `pdfs/`)
- A study **timer** with start/pause/reset
- **Local notes with tabs** (auto-saved in browser)
- **Bookmark (last page)** to remember progress
- **Font switcher** (Inter, Poppins, Roboto, System)
- **Theme switcher** (Teal, Blue, Purple, Amber, Rose, Lime, Gray)
- **Cursor styles** (Dot, Comet, Ring, Crosshair) for UI experiments

⚠️ **Educational Use Only**  
All materials are for **personal, non-commercial learning**.  
This project is to practice:

- Git/GitHub workflows  
- Static site hosting (GitHub Pages)  
- Frontend skills (HTML/CSS/JS)  
- Project structuring & organization
