# CEH Practice Pages

This repository hosts my saved **CEH practice pages** for personal study.  
I organized the raw HTML into a working GitHub Pages site with:
- Clean structure (pages/, esources/, pdfs/)
- A study **timer**, **bookmark (last page)**, and **local notes** on the index
- Minimal UI for quick navigation

⚠️ **Educational Use Only**  
All materials are for **personal, non-commercial learning**.  
This project is to practice:
- Git/GitHub workflows
- Static site hosting (GitHub Pages)
- Frontend skills (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Skills Practiced
- Git & GitHub (commits, branching, repo organization)
- GitHub Pages (static hosting)
- HTML/CSS (custom index + UI)
- JavaScript (timer, localStorage notes/bookmark)
- Project structuring (assets & PDFs)

## How to Use
1. Open: https://haziqachik.github.io/ceh-pages/
2. Click **1–7** to view pages.
3. Use **Ready to study!** to start the timer; add notes below (saved locally).
4. Set **Last page** to remember where you stopped.

## Future Plans
- Theme switcher (light/dark + accent)
- Better mobile layout
- Optional search across pages
