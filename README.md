# CEH Pages — Personal Study Archive

**Live site:** https://haziqachik.github.io/ceh-pages/  
**Purpose:** Personal, educational practice and hosting exercise.

> **Important**  
> These pages were saved for **personal study** (CEH prep). I host them to practice **Git, GitHub Pages, and web basics**. They’re **not for redistribution, resale, or commercial use**. If you are a rights holder and want content removed, please open an issue.

## What I Practiced / Learned
- **Git & GitHub:** cloning, staging/committing/pushing, handling long filenames, rolling back to specific commits.
- **GitHub Pages:** publishing static HTML/CSS, fixing asset paths, using .nojekyll.
- **Web Fundamentals:** HTML structure, minimal CSS, favicon/robots basics, linking multi-page static resources.
- **Repo Hygiene:** clear README, license, and housekeeping; keeping long filenames + _files folders intact so assets load properly.
- **Troubleshooting:** 404s, broken links, rename issues in PowerShell, and commit history management.
- **Context (SG):** working within free GitHub (public repo), focusing on learning/portfolio value.

## Project Timeline (high level)
1. **Initial upload** of CEH practice pages (long filenames + _files folders).
2. **Experiments** with renaming/shortening → assets broke → learned why originals must stay.
3. **Index page** for quick navigation.
4. **Design pass** for a clean, minimalist landing page.
5. **Documentation**: clarified educational-only use; improved README and repo settings.

## Repo Structure (kept simple so assets work)
- index.html — minimalist hub linking to the long-named pages.
- *.htm + matching *_files/ — original pages & resource folders (kept as-is so JS/CSS/images load correctly).
- .nojekyll — ensures GitHub Pages serves files untouched.

> I intentionally keep the **original long filenames** and their matching _files folders. That’s what makes all scripts/styles/images load correctly on GitHub Pages.

## How to View Locally
- **Fastest:** Double-click index.html and navigate.
- **Alternative:** Serve locally (prevents some browser restrictions):
  - VS Code **Live Server** extension, or
  - Python: python -m http.server then open http://localhost:8000/
