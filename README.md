# CEH Practice Pages (Educational Archive)

Static HTML **study pages (Parts 1–7)** saved for CEH exam preparation.  
This repo demonstrates how I organize and host static content with GitHub Pages as part of my portfolio.

## Purpose
- Personal learning archive (educational use only)
- Testing GitHub Pages hosting of offline HTML
- Demonstrating repo organization + simple CSS design

## Live Site
👉 https://haziqachik.github.io/ceh-pages/

## Disclaimer
- Original page content belongs to its source provider.
- This repository is for **personal education and portfolio** only — not for redistribution or resale.

## Technical Notes
- Long filenames are kept so `_files` resource folders load correctly.
- `.nojekyll` prevents GitHub Pages from stripping `_files`.
- `robots.txt` discourages search engine indexing (best-effort).
