# CEH Practice Pages (Educational Archive)

Static HTML **study pages (Parts 1–7)** saved for my CEH prep.  
Purpose: personal learning, testing GitHub Pages, and portfolio presentation of static hosting.

- Not for redistribution or resale  
- Original content belongs to the source provider  
- Hosted for **personal educational use** only

Technical notes:
- Long original filenames are preserved so that resource folders load correctly.
- \.nojekyll\ prevents Pages from stripping \_files\ assets.
- \obots.txt\ discourages search engines from indexing.
